## Week 1

-------------

Remember, you only need two things in order to make a webpage:

* a text editor (TextEdit, Text Wrangler, Sublime Text, Coda, etc.)
* a web browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.)

Follow the sample code in order to get the basic structure of an HTML file. Save it with the .html extension at the end of the name (example.html) and open it in the browser.

Voila! You have a web page.

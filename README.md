# Web Advanced: Javascript
### PSAM 3210: CRN 7845
____

## Course Description

#### Catalog Entry
This course will focus on extending students' knowledge of code to web and cloud. Students will be learning JavaScript, the programming language of the Web. Students will be introduced to a variety of application from server-side network programming, game development, and the creation of desktop and mobile applications. 

#### Expanded Description (My Interpretation)

Modern web development is crazy: there are thousands of different libraries, frameworks, and plugins that can be used in different applications and websites. What's hot and what's not is constantly shifting, sometimes from week to week. What's popular this year may not around the next time a website begins development. Common among many of them, however, is a single programming language: Javascript.

In this course, we'll learn how to use Javascript to improve, expand, and augment basic web development skills.   This means going back to basics, and solidifying the core understanding of programming concepts and practices before jumping into the really flashy stuff.

You'll then be ready and able to do the research and build a website that's right up your alley. Do you like data visualization? Dig deeper into APIs. What about online games? Sink your teeth into Web Sockets. Web applications? Maybe Angular is for you. The common thread to all of these topics is, of course, Javascript.

It's a great time for web development. Explore, play, make mistakes, ask questions, and have fun.

## Assignments & Grading

### Expectations
* Turn in all assignments on time. This class will move quickly. Not turning in an assignment will result in 0 pts for that week.
* **Emailing me in a panic hours before an assignment is due is unacceptable**.
* Have a positive attitude and be ready to learn. There's a lot of web out there.
* Ask questions & take care of each other.

### Homework and Projects
Students will use **GitHub** to submit all assignments.

* Students will create a **separate** repository for this class.
* Each assignment will be uploaded to this repo in separate folders, week by week.
	* Example: My repo is called oherterich-webadvanced. My folders are named week01, week02, midterm, etc., with all relevant files and code inside each respective folder. Just make it legible.
* Assignments will be checked during office hours the following Saturday.


#### 10 Assignments ( 100 pts each )
Weekly assignments. These will be broken down as follows:

* Completeness, 20 pts. ( have you completed all assigned tasks? does it work? )
* Organization, 20 pts. ( is the code clean? are files organized? )
* Iteration, 20 pts. ( commit history. has it gone through changes? how has progress been made? )
* Effort, 40 pts. ( is it well designed? has thought gone into it? )

#### Midterm ( 350 pts )
Midterm project, due on March 10. No late submissions will be accepted. Same criteria as assignments.

#### Final ( 500 pts )
Final project, due on May 12. No late submissions will be accepted. Same criteria as assignments.

#### Participation ( 150 pts )
Each class is worth 10 pts. These are divided as follows:

* Attendance, 5 pts. (are you there? are you late?)
* Participation, 5 pts. (are you paying attention? are you asking questions?)

I understand that some students might not be comfortable speaking up in class. Participation is also based on how you act/interact. To clarify:

**I can see you. I can see if you're on giggling at cat pictures, browsing Reddit, or messaging your friends.**

#### Total: 1000 pts.

## Grading Standards

#### A  [4.0; 96–100%]
Work of exceptional quality, which often goes beyond the stated goals of the course. 
#### A- [3.7; 91 –95%]
Work of very high quality. 
#### B+ [3.3; 86–90%]
Work of high quality that indicates substantially higher than average ability.

#### B  [3.0; 81–85%]
Very good work that satisfies the goals of the course. 
#### B- [2.7; 76–80%]
Good work. 
#### C+ [2.3; 71–75%]
Above-average work.

#### C  [2.0; 66–70%]
Average work that indicates an understanding of the course material; passable 
Satisfactory completion of a course is considered to be a grade of C or higher. 
#### C- [1.7; 61–65%]
Passing work but below good academic standing. 
#### D  [1.0; 46–60%]
Below-average work that indicates a student does not fully understand the assignments; 
Probation level though passing for credit.

#### F  [0.0; 0–45%]
Failure, no credit.

#### Grade of W
The grade of W may be issued by the Office of the Registrar to a student who officially withdraws from a course within the applicable deadline. There is no academic penalty, but the grade will appear on the student transcript. A grade of W may also be issued by an instructor to a graduate student (except at Parsons and Mannes) who has not completed course requirements nor arranged for an Incomplete. 
#### Grade of WF
The grade of WF is issued by an instructor to a student (all undergraduates and all graduate students) who has not attended or not completed all required work in a course but did not officially withdraw before the withdrawal deadline. It differs from an “F,” which would indicate that the student technically completed requirements but that the level of work did not qualify for a passing grade. The WF is equivalent to an F in calculating the grade point average (zero grade points), and no credit is awarded. 
#### Grades of Incomplete 
The grade of I, or temporary incomplete, may be granted to a student under unusual and extenuating circumstances, such as when the student’s academic life is interrupted by a medical or personal emergency. This mark is not given automatically but only upon the student’s request and at the discretion of the instructor. A Request for Incomplete form must be completed and signed by student and instructor. The time allowed for completion of the work and removal of the “I” mark will be set by the instructor with the following limitations: [You should include one the following standards, depending on the level of your course]. 
Work must be completed no later than the seventh week of the following fall semester for spring or summer term incompletes and no later than the seventh week of the following spring semester for fall term incompletes. Grades of “I” not revised in the prescribed time will be recorded as a final grade of “WF” by the Office of the Registrar.

## Divisional, Program and Class Policies

#### Responsibility 
Students are responsible for all assignments, even if they are absent.  Late assignments, failure to complete the assignments for class discussion and/or critique, and lack of preparedness for in-class discussions, presentations and/or critiques will jeopardize your successful completion of this course.  

#### Participation 
Class participation is an essential part of class and includes: keeping up with reading, assignments, projects, contributing meaningfully to class discussions, active participation in group work, and coming to class regularly and on time.  

#### Attendance 
Faculty members may fail any student who is absent for a significant portion of class time. A significant portion of class time is defined as three absences for classes that meet once per week and four absences for classes that meet two or more times per week. During intensive summer sessions a significant portion of class time is defined as two absences. Lateness or early departure from class may also translate into one full absence. 

#### Blackboard or Canvas
Blackboard and canvas will not be used in this course.

#### Delays 
In rare instances, I may be delayed arriving to class.  If I have not arrived by the time class is scheduled to start, you must wait a minimum of thirty minutes for my arrival.  In the event that I will miss class entirely, a sign will be posted at the classroom indicating your assignment for the next class meeting.

#### Electronic Devices 
Use of electronic devices (phones, tablets, laptops) is permitted when the device is being used in relation to the course's work. All other uses are prohibited in the classroom and devices should be turned off before class starts.

#### Academic Honesty and Integrity
The New School views “academic honesty and integrity” as the duty of every member of an academic community to claim authorship for his or her own work and only for that work, and to recognize the contributions of others accurately and completely. This obligation is fundamental to the integrity of intellectual debate, and creative and academic pursuits. Academic honesty and integrity includes accurate use of quotations, as well as appropriate and explicit citation of sources in instances of paraphrasing and describing ideas, or reporting on research findings or any aspect of the work of others (including that of faculty members and other students). Academic dishonesty results from infractions of this “accurate use”. The standards of academic honesty and integrity, and citation of sources, apply to all forms of academic work, including submissions of drafts of final papers or projects. All members of the University community are expected to conduct themselves in accord with the standards of academic honesty and integrity. Please see the complete policy in the Parsons Catalog.

It is the responsibility of students to learn the procedures specific to their discipline for correctly and appropriately differentiating their own work from that of others.  Compromising your academic integrity may lead to serious consequences, including (but not limited to) one or more of the following: failure of the assignment, failure of the course, academic warning, disciplinary probation, suspension from the university, or dismissal from the university.  

#### Student Disability Services (SDS)
In keeping with the University’s policy of providing equal access for students with disabilities, any student with a disability who needs academic accommodations is welcome to meet with me privately.  All conversations will be kept confidential.  Students requesting any accommodations will also need to meet with Jason Luchs in the Office of Student Disability Services, who will conduct an intake, and if appropriate, provide an academic accommodation notification letter to you to bring to me.  SDS assists students with disabilities in need of academic and programmatic accommodations as required by the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973. http://www.newschool.edu/studentservices/disability/.
